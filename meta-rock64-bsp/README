How to Build
============

This repository implements a kas project. The files under kas/ contain
configurations that build images for the Rock64 for each release of the Yocto
project. Currently, dunfell and hardknott are supported. To build, install the
kas-container wrapper for kas (https://github.com/siemens/kas), then:

    git clone https://github.com/AmateurECE/yocto-rock64
    kas-container build yocto-rock64/kas/hardknott.yaml

This configuration builds core-image-base, but that can obviously be altered by
changing conf/local.conf. The -sdimg file the deploy directory (e.g.
build/tmp/deploy/images/core-image-base-rock64.rock64-sdimg) should then be
flashed to the board to boot. A convenience script, tools/FlashSd.sh is
provided. One can flash the image to an SD card, for example, with:

    sudo ./Flash.sh image.rock64-sdimg /dev/disk2
